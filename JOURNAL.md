<h1>Learned How to Design a PCB</h1>
<h2>December 11, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent:2.8Hours</h3>
<p>Today through youtube, I learned how to design a PCB on Kikad and started building my first PCB design. Before I worked with breadboard circuitry but never designed a PCB. The one I am designing right now is not related to any project. It's just an tutorial piece. I am gonna make my main project PCB next day. The whole circuitry is on my head right now.

<h1>Completed my first PCB</h1>
<h2>December 12, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent:2.5Hours</h3>
<p>Today I completed my basic learning on building PCB and built an mini inverter PCB watching a tutorial. I leant how to make Gerber file and what to send to PCB manufacturer to manufacture my PCB. I hope from the next day, I can start building my project PCB.

<h1>Started making Schematics, researched on how to control AC.</h1>
<h2>December 13, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent time: 4 Hours</h3>
<p>Today I started building my project PCB and done research on how to control AC average voltage with a TRIAC and ESP 32. Bought some things to practically learn about TRIACS.

<h1>Finished doing Schematics</h1>
<h2>December 15, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent time: 8 Hours</h3>
<p>I am journaling after two days as I was busy researching on how to control AC voltage via ESP 32. I couldn't get the TRIOPS work so I switched to capacitor based step regulator. And after calculating my preferences and everything it took me a lot of time to do the schematics properly. I used a lot of labels as so many wirings might make it look messy.</p>

<h1>Modified Schematics for safety</h1>
<h2>December 17, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent time: 5 Hours</h3>
<p>Modified my final schematics to make it safe and sustainable against AC currents. Did a lot of research on making it safe and placed apropiate safety measures.</p>

<h1>Started Designing PCB</h1>
<h2>December 18, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent time: 2.5 Hours</h3>
<p>I started to design PCB today. First I assigned footprint to all of the components and started making PCB design. Researched how to put it on right place and decided where to put which components and started doing it. I wanted to complete routing today but couldn't due to limited time.</p>

<h1>Routed the PCB and Completed the hardware part.</h1>
<h2>December 22, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent Time: 8 Hours</h3>
<p>Today I completed all my work of hardware on Kikad. I completed my PCB designing ensuring no error persisted. I checked it many times and found flaws until it showed no errors. I fixed all my errors and flaws and made it a workable PCB. I am very happy today. And I didn't journal for couple of days as my goal of routing PCB wasn't completed</p>

<h1>Completed the coding part.</h1>
<h2>December 23, 2025</h2>
<h3>Spent time: 4 Hours</h3>
<p>Today I wrote whole logic of my my system and used AI to code more efficiently. I tested all logics by lighting LED and ensuring signal is going properly wherever is need.</p>
